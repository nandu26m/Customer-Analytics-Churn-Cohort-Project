## Churn Cohort Project

### 1. **Data Engineering & Automation**

* **Build automated ETL pipelines** to load, clean, and transform data daily/weekly (Airflow, dbt, or simple Python scripts with cron jobs).
* Use SQL databases (PostgreSQL, BigQuery) or Data Warehouses for scalable storage.
* Version control all scripts + notebooks with Git.

### 2. **Advanced Cohort & Retention Analysis**

* Define **multi-dimensional cohorts**, not just by signup date, but also:

  * Acquisition channel
  * Subscription plan
  * Geography (country, region)
* Calculate **advanced retention metrics:**

  * Rolling retention rates (e.g., Day 1, 7, 30, 60, 90)
  * Churn rates by segment
  * Lifetime Value (LTV) projections per cohort and segment
* Build **customer segmentation** using clustering (K-means, hierarchical) on behavior.

### 3. **Dashboards & Reporting**

* Build **interactive dashboards** (Tableau, Power BI, or Streamlit/Plotly Dash) to explore:

  * Retention trends by cohort and segment
  * Revenue impact of churn
  * User engagement metrics
* Schedule automatic report delivery (email, Slack).

### 4. **Predictive Modeling**

* Build **churn prediction models**:

  * Feature engineering from user activity, payment history, support tickets, promotions
  * Use supervised ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
  * Evaluate with precision, recall, ROC-AUC
* Deploy models via APIs or batch scoring pipelines.

### 5. **Experimentation & Causal Analysis**

* Analyze **impact of promotions, product changes, or support interventions** on retention:

  * Use A/B testing or quasi-experimental designs
  * Measure uplift and causality, not just correlation

### 6. **Documentation & Reproducibility**

* Write clean, modular, reusable code with docstrings.
* Use **notebooks + scripts** for exploration and production-ready code.
* Maintain detailed README and architecture diagrams.

# Concrete Next Steps for the Project

1. **Enhance Data Schema & Data Collection**

   * Add tables for user events (page visits, feature usage)
   * Track detailed payment history and refunds
   * Capture subscription status changes with timestamps (start/end/renewal/cancellation)

2. **Build a Data Pipeline**

   * Use Airflow or Prefect to automate data ingestion + transformation daily
   * Store transformed data in a data warehouse (BigQuery, Snowflake)

3. **Advanced Analysis Notebook**

   * Segment cohorts by plan, channel, and geography
   * Calculate monthly LTV and ARPU per cohort
   * Create retention curves, churn curves per segment

4. **Dashboard Prototype**

   * Build a Streamlit app or Tableau dashboard showing retention heatmaps, LTV curves, churn funnel
   * Add filters for plan type, signup channel, region

5. **Build & Evaluate Churn Prediction Model**

   * Engineer features from subscriptions, payments, cancellations, support tickets, logins
   * Train and validate models with cross-validation
   * Explain key churn drivers with SHAP or feature importance

6. **Set up Documentation & Version Control**

   * Use GitHub repo with clear folders: data, notebooks, src, dashboards
   * Document code and analysis decisions
   * Write a project report / blog post summarizing insights
