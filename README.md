# SaaS Data Pipeline & Analytics Project

## Overview  
This project demonstrates a full end-to-end data pipeline for a SaaS-like environment, from synthetic data generation and database design to cloud data warehousing, querying, and advanced analytics. The goal is to simulate realistic user, revenue, and behavioral data, build ETL processes, and perform meaningful data analysis and predictive modeling.

---

## Process So Far — Summary & Stage

### Data Generation
- Used Python’s Faker library to create synthetic but realistic data for prototyping and testing.
- Enables rapid iteration without relying on real user data.

### Schema & Relationships
- Designed a normalized database schema in Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) with multiple tables and proper relationships.
- Ensures data integrity and realistic relational joins.

### Data Upload
- Populated MSSQL tables with generated data.
- Verified data quality by running SQL queries within MSSQL.

### ETL to BigQuery
- Developed a Python ETL script that connects to MSSQL, extracts data, and loads it into Google BigQuery.
- Simulates a pipeline from on-prem transactional database to a cloud data warehouse.

### Querying & Analysis
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and cohort analysis using SQL queries on BigQuery.
- Transitioned from data creation to meaningful insights.

## Next Steps

1. **Validate Data Consistency & Integrity**  
   Verify data in BigQuery exactly matches MSSQL using checksums, counts, and sample queries.

2. **Automate the ETL Process**  
   Schedule regular ETL runs using tools like Apache Airflow, Cloud Functions + Scheduler, or cron jobs.  
   Move from full reloads to incremental updates.

3. **Build Visualizations & Dashboards**  
   Connect BigQuery to visualization tools such as Google Data Studio, Tableau, or Looker.  
   Create dashboards for user growth, retention, revenue, promo codes, and churn.

4. **Advanced Analysis & Modeling**  
   Leverage Python and BigQuery ML to build predictive models for churn, revenue forecasting, user segmentation, and retention analysis.

5. **Document the Pipeline & Insights**  
   Create detailed documentation including data dictionary, pipeline architecture, key metrics, and limitations.

6. **Improve Data Realism & Scale**  
   Add more complexity and correlation in synthetic data, simulate time-series behavior, and scale data volume for performance testing.

7. **Explore Production-Ready Tools**  
   Evaluate orchestration and transformation tools like Google Cloud Dataflow, Apache Beam, or dbt for production workflows and cost optimization.
