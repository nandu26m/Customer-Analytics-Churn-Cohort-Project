# Customer-Analytics-Churn-Cohort-Project

To do a **Churn-Retention-Cohort Analysis** project effectively, follow these structured steps. This type of project is a great showcase of your ability to understand customer behavior, retention dynamics, and lifetime value.

---

### 🔧 **1. Define Objectives**

Clearly state what you want to analyze. For example:

* What is the churn rate over time?
* Which cohorts have the best retention?
* Are there patterns in user behavior before churn?
* How do acquisition channels, product usage, or time-to-conversion impact retention?

---

### 📦 **2. Gather or Simulate Data**

**Data needs may include:**

* `user_id`, `signup_date`, `last_active_date`
* Demographics or marketing channel
* Subscription/payment history
* Engagement or event logs (e.g., app visits, purchases)

**Options:**

* Use synthetic datasets (you can simulate cohorts)
* Use open datasets like:

  * [Online Retail Dataset (UCI)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)
  * [Telco Customer Churn (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
  * [Mock data generators](https://www.mockaroo.com/)

---

### 🧹 **3. Data Preprocessing**

* Parse dates and calculate metrics like:

  * `tenure = last_active_date - signup_date`
  * `is_churned = True` if inactive for X days
* Bucket users by signup month (`cohort_month`)
* Clean nulls, standardize formats

---

### 📊 **4. Cohort Analysis**

**Steps:**

1. Assign a **cohort group** based on signup month
2. Track how many users remain active over time (monthly retention)
3. Create a **retention matrix**

**Tools:**

* Python (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
* SQL (for cohort calculations)
* Tableau/Power BI (for dashboarding)

**Sample code snippet:**

```python
df['cohort_month'] = df['signup_date'].dt.to_period('M')
df['active_month'] = df['last_active_date'].dt.to_period('M')
df['cohort_index'] = (df['active_month'] - df['cohort_month']).apply(attrgetter('n'))
```

---

### 📉 **5. Churn & Retention Analysis**

**Metrics:**

* Retention rate = retained users / cohort size
* Churn rate = 1 - retention rate
* Average lifetime
* LTV (if monetary data is available)

You can visualize:

* **Retention heatmap** per cohort
* **Churn curves** over time
* **Funnel charts** if stages exist (signup → activation → retention)

---

### 🧠 **6. Key Insights & Patterns**

* Which cohorts have high early churn?
* Does onboarding period affect retention?
* Do certain channels produce more loyal users?
* What features correlate with long-term engagement?

---

### 🛠️ **7. Optional Advanced Add-ons**

* **Survival analysis** using `lifelines` (e.g., Kaplan-Meier curves)
* **Segmented analysis** by age group, region, acquisition channel
* **Dashboard** with filters by cohort, plan, etc.
* Predictive churn model using logistic regression or XGBoost

---

### 🚀 **8. Present the Project**

Prepare:

* A well-documented **Jupyter Notebook**
* A visual summary or **Tableau dashboard**
* A clear **README** in the repo explaining:

  * Objective
  * Tools used
  * Key findings
  * Screenshots or GIFs
