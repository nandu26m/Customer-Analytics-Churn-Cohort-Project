# Customer-Analytics-Churn-Cohort-Project

To do a **Churn-Retention-Cohort Analysis** project effectively, follow these structured steps. This type of project is a great showcase of your ability to understand customer behavior, retention dynamics, and lifetime value.

---

### 🔧 **1. Define Objectives**

Clearly state what you want to analyze. For example:

* What is the churn rate over time?
* Which cohorts have the best retention?
* Are there patterns in user behavior before churn?
* How do acquisition channels, product usage, or time-to-conversion impact retention?

---

### 📦 **2. Gather or Simulate Data**

**Data needs may include:**

* `user_id`, `signup_date`, `last_active_date`
* Demographics or marketing channel
* Subscription/payment history
* Engagement or event logs (e.g., app visits, purchases)

**Options:**

* Use synthetic datasets (you can simulate cohorts)
* Use open datasets like:

  * [Online Retail Dataset (UCI)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)
  * [Telco Customer Churn (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
  * [Mock data generators](https://www.mockaroo.com/)

---

### 🧹 **3. Data Preprocessing**

* Parse dates and calculate metrics like:

  * `tenure = last_active_date - signup_date`
  * `is_churned = True` if inactive for X days
* Bucket users by signup month (`cohort_month`)
* Clean nulls, standardize formats

---

### 📊 **4. Cohort Analysis**

**Steps:**

1. Assign a **cohort group** based on signup month
2. Track how many users remain active over time (monthly retention)
3. Create a **retention matrix**

**Tools:**

* Python (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
* SQL (for cohort calculations)
* Tableau/Power BI (for dashboarding)

**Sample code snippet:**

```python
df['cohort_month'] = df['signup_date'].dt.to_period('M')
df['active_month'] = df['last_active_date'].dt.to_period('M')
df['cohort_index'] = (df['active_month'] - df['cohort_month']).apply(attrgetter('n'))
```

---

### 📉 **5. Churn & Retention Analysis**

**Metrics:**

* Retention rate = retained users / cohort size
* Churn rate = 1 - retention rate
* Average lifetime
* LTV (if monetary data is available)

You can visualize:

* **Retention heatmap** per cohort
* **Churn curves** over time
* **Funnel charts** if stages exist (signup → activation → retention)

---

### 🧠 **6. Key Insights & Patterns**

* Which cohorts have high early churn?
* Does onboarding period affect retention?
* Do certain channels produce more loyal users?
* What features correlate with long-term engagement?

---

### 🛠️ **7. Optional Advanced Add-ons**

* **Survival analysis** using `lifelines` (e.g., Kaplan-Meier curves)
* **Segmented analysis** by age group, region, acquisition channel
* **Dashboard** with filters by cohort, plan, etc.
* Predictive churn model using logistic regression or XGBoost

---

### 🚀 **8. Present the Project**

Prepare:

* A well-documented **Jupyter Notebook**
* A visual summary or **Tableau dashboard**
* A clear **README** in the repo explaining:

  * Objective
  * Tools used
  * Key findings
  * Screenshots or GIFs

## ✅ STEP 1: **Set Up Your Project Folder/Repo**

**Folder structure:**

```
Churn-Cohort-Analysis/
│
├── data/                 # Raw and processed datasets
├── notebooks/            # Jupyter or Colab notebooks
├── src/                  # Python scripts (optional)
├── outputs/              # Plots, charts, exports
├── README.md             # Overview of the project
└── requirements.txt      # List of libraries used
```

---

## ✅ STEP 2: **Choose or Create Your Dataset**

### Option A: Use a real dataset

Example: [Telco Churn Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

* Download it → place in `data/`
* Inspect it using Pandas (`df.head()`, `df.info()`)

### Option B: Simulate cohort data (if you want full control)

You can use Python and libraries like `Faker` or `Mockaroo` for fake data. Ask me if you want help generating synthetic data.

---

## ✅ STEP 3: **Create Your First Jupyter Notebook**

Inside `notebooks/`, name it something like:

```
01_initial_exploration.ipynb
```

### Add these first cells:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import datetime as dt

# Load your dataset
df = pd.read_csv('../data/telco_churn.csv')  # adjust path if needed
df.head()
```

---

## ✅ STEP 4: **Clean & Prepare Data**

Key tasks:

* Convert date columns to datetime format
* Create `cohort_month` from signup date
* Create `tenure` or `active_month` for each customer
* Filter out invalid or missing data

Example:

```python
df['signup_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['signup_date'])
df['cohort_month'] = df['signup_date'].dt.to_period('M')
```

---

## ✅ STEP 5: **Build a Cohort Retention Table**

Create a matrix of:
**Cohort on rows × Retention period on columns**

I can provide the exact code when you share a sample of your dataset.

---

## ✅ STEP 6: **Visualize Retention & Churn**

* Use Seaborn heatmaps for retention matrix
* Plot churn over time
* Highlight patterns across cohorts

Example:

```python
sns.heatmap(retention_matrix, annot=True, fmt=".0%", cmap="coolwarm")
```

---

## ✅ STEP 7: **Document Everything**

Update your `README.md` with:

* Project overview
* Goals
* Tools
* Sample visual
* Summary of findings

---

## ✅ STEP 8: **Optional Enhancements**

* Add SQL queries (if working from a DB)
* Add Tableau dashboard
* Create a simple Streamlit app for interactivity
* Predict churn using ML
