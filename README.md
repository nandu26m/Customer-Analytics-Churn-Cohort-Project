# SaaS Data Pipeline & Analytics Project

## Overview  
This project demonstrates a full end-to-end data pipeline for a SaaS-like environment, covering synthetic data generation, relational database design, cloud data warehousing, exploratory analysis, and advanced modeling. It simulates realistic user behavior and revenue data to showcase data engineering and analytics skills.

---

## Process Summary & Accomplishments

### Data Generation
- Created synthetic data using Pythonâ€™s Faker library for realistic prototyping and testing.
- Ensured data variability and realism for meaningful analysis.

### Schema & Relationships
- Designed a normalized database schema in Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) with appropriate tables and foreign key relationships.
- Ensured data integrity and accurate joins.

### Data Upload
- Populated MSSQL tables with generated data.
- Validated data quality with SQL queries inside MSSQL.

### ETL to BigQuery
- Developed a Python ETL pipeline that extracts data from MSSQL and loads it into Google BigQuery.
- Simulated a modern data pipeline migrating on-premise transactional data to a cloud warehouse.

### Querying & Analysis
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and cohort analysis using SQL in BigQuery.
- Derived actionable insights from the generated data.

### Advanced Analysis & Modeling
- Integrated BigQuery ML and Python for predictive modeling:
  - Churn prediction,
  - Revenue forecasting,
  - User segmentation via clustering,
  - Identification of key retention and LTV factors.
- Added predictive power on top of descriptive analysis.

### Visualization
- Created dashboards connecting BigQuery with Looker Studio (Google Data Studio).
- Visualized key metrics like user growth, retention, churn, promo usage, and revenue trends.

### Documentation & Automation
- Documented the full data pipeline, schema, and analysis steps.
- Automated data generation, ETL, and analysis workflows.
